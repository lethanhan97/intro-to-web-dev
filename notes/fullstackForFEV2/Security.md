# Security 

What could someone do if they gain ~~root~~ access to your server? :o 

SO MANY THINGS

e.g

- Getting your password and try that password for other things
- Redirect your sites to their nefarious sites
- Man in the middle attack :o
- Run their own server on your server, get your server banned, and then lock your legit stuff out
- Lock you out of your own server
- Scrape your DB
- Turn your server into a botnet



## Security Checklist

- SSH. Don't use password!
- Use firewalls
- Updates often!
- 2FA
- VPN
