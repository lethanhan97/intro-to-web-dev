# Big O Notation

The way that we analyze how efficient algorithms is.

Measure how much time it takes for an algorithm to complete and how much space it takes for an algorithm to complete

- O(1): no loop
- O(n): Single loop
- O(log n): Divide and conquer. The more values added, the increase in time diminishes
- O(n^2): Nested loop
